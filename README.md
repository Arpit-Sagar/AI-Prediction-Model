# AI-Prediction-Model
Artificial Intelligence Project on regression model for prediction of gold prices.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning model useful for solving both regression 
and classification problems. 

This supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble 
learning method for regression.
It operates using multiple decision trees and makes the final prediction using the 
bagging method.
